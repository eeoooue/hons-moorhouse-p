# MAli - Reproducibility Package

This folder contains software packages, test datasets and automated test scripts to support reproduction of results from the evaluation of MAli - an iterative aligner.

The package is organised into 3 categories:

1. [Requirements](./01-Requirements/) - Contains automated tests that explicitly test functional requirements of MAli v1.31

2. [Releases](./02-Releases/) - Supports the independent testing of each of the released iterations of MAli on BALIS-2 testcases

3. [Case Study](./03-CaseStudy/) - A comparative study comparing the performance of MAli v1.31 relative to existing alignment software packages. 

#### Prerequisites
