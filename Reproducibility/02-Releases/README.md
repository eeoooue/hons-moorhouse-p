## Release Testing

This directory contains notebooks for testing the 8 released iterations of MAli, from v0.1 to v1.31.

Each version can be tested by running the associated notebook to completion. 

As iteration counts are specified and a randomness seed of is specified for each test, the results should be exactly reproducible.

In the ```02a-Plot-Performances``` notebook and .pdf, the performances of all iterations can be viewed as a multiple line plot.

> Note: These versions of the release tests have been revised for reproducibility - using a common randomness seed and specifying iterations rather than seconds of runtime. As such the results differ slightly than those found in sprint reports and development evidence for the project.
