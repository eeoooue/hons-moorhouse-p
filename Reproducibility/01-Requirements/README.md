2. Performing Alignment of a Large Testcase
3. Performing Batch Alignment of a Series of Input Files
4. Performing Iterative Refinement of an Existing Alignment
5. Approximating the Pareto Front of Trade-off Alignments

Each test-plan is implemented as a jupyter notebook and has an associated subfolder within this directory. Each notebook is paired with a .pdf export of a completed test run. To conduct a test for yourself, simply run the associated jupyter notebook to completion.
