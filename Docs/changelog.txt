Hi Dr Parker,

I've now finished a submission-ready version of my PDD and I'm hoping to submit it later today (submissions are unlimited).
However, I'm worried about my tables of tasks & milestones as I haven't shown you them before & wanted to check if they are presented in an acceptable manner (see attached).
Overall, the document is 2380 words, but my tables, references & appendix push the MS Word counter up to 4271, which is making me anxious.

Overview of key changes to my PDD:
- added tasks & milestones, presented as tables.
- revised my objectives
	- added 'produce a competitive quality tool' as it's own objective distinct from 'conduct a case study'
	- removed 'show alignment progress in UI' - this can be captured as a requirement
- added appendix items: MSA Glossary & Prioritized Development Backlog

Please let me know what you think about the tables if you have time.

Kind regards,

Peter

PS. I hope you are in good health after this weekend! I'm just waiting to hear from Mark H. before I can make my UKIEPC team.
