one of the key compromises to consider in metaheuristics

do we exploit knowledge we already have

or do we explore more of the search space to ensure we don't miss out on something better?


In most cases, metaheuristic methods adopt or resemble hill-climbing in some form. In na√Øve hill-climbing, we can make incremental improvements to a solution by adopting better candidates from its 'neighbourhood' - other solution states that can be reached from the current solution in some logical way. This is referred to as **exploitation** - we are using available information to try to improve the solution. 

A problem often encountered with overly **exploitative** strategies is that they can get caught in **local optima**, finding themselves stuck at a solution state that is at least as good as neighbouring solution states, but is objectively worse than the globally optimal solution. Consider **Figure** below, in which many local optima can be seen as the peaks of 'hills' in the search space.

**Exploration** on the other hand, refers to diversity in the solution states considered. In explorative strategies, the sample of solutions considered is more representative of the search space as a whole. However, we can likely improve on these candidates through **exploitation** and thus a compromise is appropriate.
