Metaheuristics are a collection of general strategies for solving problems. They are frameworks or skeleton algorithms that can be used to tackle a wide variety of problems across many disciplines. 

These methods do not guarantee finding the best possible solution to a problem, but instead present efficient ways to explore the search space in an iterative manner. Further, they allow for domain knowledge to be incorporated into the algorithm in the form of objective functions that are used to guide the search process.
