my problem is a MOO one so I need to touch on this


MOO is relevant to many real-world problems, and is often found in how many of us making buying decisions etc.

need to talk about domination according to pareto optimality

talk about pareto front

include diagrams

explain how we don't guarantee full pareto front with metaheuristics
but do aim to find / maintain some non dominated set

usually using an archive
