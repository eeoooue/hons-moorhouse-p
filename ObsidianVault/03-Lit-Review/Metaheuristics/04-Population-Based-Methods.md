These are kinda antagonists for this project


probably cover
- artificial bee colony
- ant colony optimization
- bacterial foraging
- cuckoo search
- particle swarm optimizer
- genetic algorithm
	- evolutionary algorithms in general

Many metaheuristic approaches maintain a population of solution states throughout the process of searching for a high quality solution. Often, these designs incorporate analogies from the real world, especially nature - known as 'bio-inspired' algorithms (TODO: cite). 

Access to a population allows for comparison, interaction and even cooperation (conceptually) between solutions that may lie far apart from each other in the search space. These operations can be used to promote exploration in population-based methods (TODO: cite LukeS).

In the case of evolutionary algorithms, elements of different solutions from a population can be combined together to create new child solutions with qualities of both parents. The general structure an evolutionary algorithm is presented below in **Figure**, and elements of this approach are often incorporated into other population-based algorithms.

TODO: add a figure here
