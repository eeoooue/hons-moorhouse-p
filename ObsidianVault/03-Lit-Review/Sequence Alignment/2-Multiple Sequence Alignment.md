The task of aligning more than two biological sequences 

is NP-hard & unfeasible to compute exactly 

(opportunity for visual examples)


has appliccations in a range of bioinformatics analysis tasks

including producing a phylogenetic tree, which can show the evolutionary relationships between many different species at once, similar to a family tree.
