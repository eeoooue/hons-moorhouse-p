the marriage of computer science and biology

concerns itself with dealing with vast amounts of biological data
- recording technologies
- analysis
- curating/managing vast amounts of biological data in databases

the rate at which we are able to record biological data has been going up over time

this has increased the demand for efficient analysis tools - including aligners, as the workload (amount of input) has increased drastically

show increase in recent years of dna samples or protein sequences (TODO: add figure)

talk about next-generation s equencing

could mention the transcription of the human genome?
