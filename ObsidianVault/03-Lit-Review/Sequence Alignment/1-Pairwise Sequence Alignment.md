Alignment of only two biological sequences

has known optimal solution using dynamic programming

(good opportunity to give visual examples)


sequence alignment can show use what kind of evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) exist between species. this can be found by comparing dna, but also comparing protein sequences that perform similar functions; e.g. haemoglobin in mice & humans (is similar)
