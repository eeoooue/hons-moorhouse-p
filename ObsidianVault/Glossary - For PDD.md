**Alignment** - A matrix of ASCII characters resulting from the comparison of biological sequences to identify regions of similarity that may represent evolutionary relationships. (Biosynthesis, n.d.).

**BAliBASE** - A collection of structural reference alignments of protein sequences, for use in structural benchmarking to evaluate MSA software (Thompson et al., 1999).

**Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)** - The process of aligning a set of biological sequences to best highlight any evolutionary relationships between the sequences. (Biosynthesis, n.d.).

**Substitution Matrix** - A matrix used to score individual pairs of residues within a column of an alignment. These matrices are a source of domain knowledge, having been constructed based on models of protein evolution, and indicate how likely a pair of residues are to have once shared a position in a common ancestor (Biosynthesis, n.d.).

**Structural Benchmarking** - The evaluation of an alignment software tool, by comparing alignments produced by the tool against 'gold standard' structural reference alignments of the same sequences (Thompson et al., 1999).

**Structural Reference Alignment** - An alignment of protein sequences constructed by experts in the field based on their known 3D structure, from which certain evolutionary relationships can be inferred (Thompson et al., 1999).
