There will be a PDD + interim checkpoint this year
- the PDD is a deliverable + should go in my gantt etc.

When I make objectives they need to be [[SMART Objectives]]

Reading the Appendix should be entirely optional;
- I want to adopt mentality of **I need to include this as evidence** & the appendix is suitable
- rather than "i want to include this somewhere, I could put it in my appendix" 

Complex notation does have a place in defining my problem
- could use rich diagrams + annotations to explain things too though

When planning things out (gantt) / scheduling; include breaks!

I should be more specific than just saying "I will test my software":
- a case study / a comparative study
- session of testing my non-functional requirements etc.

The word reference manager can be sufficient
