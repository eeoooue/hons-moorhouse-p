Check if my objectives are on the right lines
What about my intro / brief 

How indepth to go on biology stuff?


I intend to:
- Breakdown my objectives into tasks
- Plan out tasks with MS Project in Fenner - with breaks in the schedule!

I don't think I have many ethical concerns
- just appropriate conduct from me RE: testing? / fair & transparent testing
