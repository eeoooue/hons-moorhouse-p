**Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)** - the process of aligning a set of biological sequences to best highlight any evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

**Alignment** - A matrix of ASCII characters resulting from the comparison of biological sequences to identify regions of similarity that may represent evolutionary relationships. 

**Substitution Matrix** - A matrix used to score alignments between pairs of residues within a column. The matrix is a source of domain knowledge, having been constructed based on models of protein evolution, and indicates how likely a pair of residues are to have once shared a position in a common ancestor (Biosynthesis, n.d.).

**BAliBASE** - a collection of structural reference alignments of protein sequences, for use in structural benchmarking to evaluate MSA software (Thompson et al., 1999).

**Structural Benchmarking** - the evaluation of an alignment software tool, by comparing alignments produced by the tool against 'gold standard' structural reference alignments of the same sequences. Established metrics used in this comparison are the Sum of Pairs (SP) and Total Column (TC) scores. (cite an appraisal of alignments?)

**Structural Reference Alignment** - a set of protein sequences aligned by experts in the field based on their known structure, from which certain evolutionary relationships can be inferred. Within a reference alignment, specific columns are denoted as 'core blocks' to be assessed.

**Sum of Pairs Score** **(SP)** - a binary score representing the proportion of aligned residue pairs in the reference alignment that have been correctly aligned in the alignment under test.

**Total Column Score (TC)** - a binary score representing the proportion of complete columns (core blocks) in the reference alignment which have been perfectly reproduced in the alignment under test.
