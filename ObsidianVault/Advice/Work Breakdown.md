gives worked example on 3rd oct

mind map -> ? -> estimate time for atomic tasks (in weeks)

says treat wk 11 as deadline (leave a week to spare)

gives heuristic:
- we want tasks of size 1week ideally, 2 weeks okay, bigger is a no.
interim review in jan, in which we replan

milestones vs deliverables
- milestone is just an intermediate goal

suggests 5-6 milestones; for me: (? todo: use?)
- i perform msa correctly
- i demonstrate single state
- i finish lit review
- i perform pareto optimization
- i performed a case study
- my sprint deliverables are milestones?

there will be a [[critical path]]
