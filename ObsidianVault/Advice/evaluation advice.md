- aims/objectives
- fr/nfr testing
- for me - case study
- did the project stay on schedule

---

evaluate using cmmo

criteria is the numerical goal
methodology is how I attempt to measure that
measures are what i will record
outcomes are how i translate that into a conclusion/comment

----

needs to be a holistic view of the project

-----

decide 2 things:
- is the project finished? were the objectives met?
- is the project successful? what are the outcomes?

---

evaluate all of:
- aims/objectives realised
- software itself
- execution of the project

AND reflect on the process itself

TODO: mention choice of tools for proj. management?

how did my automated tests go?
- i could outline a test scenario for checking the software works
 my plan of this should be in the pdd
