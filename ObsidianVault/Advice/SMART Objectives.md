Specific - clearly state what is to be done & by who

Measurable - how the action / objective will be measured as 'done' or not

Achievable - the goal must not be too lofty / unreachable

Relevant - should align with priorities at hand

Time-bound - should have a set deadline

Of these, not all appear relevant to my Honour's project as it is primarily my work (supervised).

Time-bound is good!
Relevant is easy to assess.

I'm going to focus on Measurable & Time Bound.
