This project will oversee the development of a command-line tool that performs the specialist task of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). 

Unlike some currently available sequence alignment packages such as ClustalX, a rich graphical user interface (GUI) will not be developed as part of this project. 

By restricting development to the production of a CLI tool, achieving compatibility across different platforms will become more feasible. The most popular alignment packages, such as MUSCLE, MAFFT and ClustalOmega are available as CLI tools and this allows for straightforward introduction into analysis pipelines.



the software will have better compatibility across different operating systems, and will be more straightforward to integrate into the analysis pipelines of bioinformaticians today.
