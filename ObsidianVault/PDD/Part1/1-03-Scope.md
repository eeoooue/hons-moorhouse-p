This project will oversee the development of a command-line tool that performs the specialist task of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). 

Unlike some currently available packages such as ClustalX, a colourful, graphical user interface will not be included in the final product.

By restricting development to the production of a CLI tool, the software will have better compatibility across different operating systems, and will be more straightforward to integrate into the analysis pipelines of bioinformaticians today.
