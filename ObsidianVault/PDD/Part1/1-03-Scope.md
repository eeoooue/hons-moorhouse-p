> Remember that a project is a well-defined piece of work.  In this section, explain what is included in the project, and just as importantly, what is not?  Think about what someone reading the description might expect, and if there are elements which might seem obvious, but you're not going to do, make sure you say so.

This project will oversee the development of a command-line tool that performs the specialist task of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). 

Unlike some currently available sequence alignment packages such as ClustalX, a rich graphical user interface (GUI) will not be developed as part of this project. 

Further, while there are multiple categories of alignment software, namely progressive, iterative and exact, in this project only iterative alignment methods will be developed.

By restricting development to the production of a CLI tool, achieving compatibility across different platforms will become more feasible. The most popular alignment packages, such as MUSCLE, MAFFT and ClustalOmega are available as CLI tools and this allows for straightforward introduction into analysis pipelines.



the software will have better compatibility across different operating systems, and will be more straightforward to integrate into the analysis pipelines of bioinformaticians today.
