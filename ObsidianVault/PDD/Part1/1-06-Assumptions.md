(I'm not really sure these are assumptions at all? maybe revisit everything here)

I don't have a full understanding of the biology side of things & I can't make algorithmic improvements or new objective functions powered by some deep insight into the field

Nor can identify sensitive errors that my program maybe making
- I do not have an experts opinion assessing my software, it is assessed in terms of the established balibase metrics measured by QScore

If there is some way to game the scores while producing output useless to bioinformaticians my program may fall into this trap

----

my primary assumption is about how a strong performance in terms of the QScore/BAliBASE metrics on the structural benchmarks is indicative of a high quality alignment tool.
