Objectives need to be **SMART** - [[SMART Objectives]]

- Produce alignment tool that performs MSA on a set of supplied sequences, conserving the biological information of the sequences themselves. (i.e. no information loss/misinformation)
	- Will be tested for in automated tests

- Produce a tool which can align testcases of n x n in y amount of time?
- Produce a tool which aligns testcases in less than x seconds?
- Produce a tool that uses the established FASTA file formats
- Assess whether a single-state methods can be viable alternatives to a typical genetic algorithm approach with a comparative study.

#### Performing MSA - efficiently

Deliver a command-line tool that can perform multiple sequence alignment on a testcase of 3 protein sequences on a university desktop computer within 5 minutes. **(Sprint 3)**

Deliver a command-line tool that can perform multiple sequence alignment on a testcase of 5 protein sequences on a university desktop computer within 1 minute. **(Sprint 5)**

Deliver a command-line tool that can perform multiple sequence alignment on a testcase of 8 protein sequences on a university desktop computer within 10 seconds. **(Sprint 6)**

#### Work with Established File Formats

Deliver an alignment tool that can read a set of biological sequences from a FASTA file (.faa) specified as a command line argument. **(Sprint 4)** 

Deliver an alignment tool that can output an alignment of biological sequences as a FASTA file (.faa) to the location specified in a command-line argument. **(Sprint 4)** 

#### Experiment with metaheuristics

By conducting an experiment, identify a heuristic for deciding on the number of iterations of improvement to be performed for each set of input sequences. **(Sprint 6)**

By conducting an experiment, contrast, assess and discuss quantitative differences between using a population-based or single-state metaheuristic method as the basis for the alignment software. **(Sprint 7**)

-------

Produce an alignment tool that is compatible with Windows 11, Ubuntu and MacOS desktop computing platforms.

Provide sufficient descriptions of testing configurations such that tests of the software can be reproduced by others. i.e. specify the testcases used and the version of software tested.
