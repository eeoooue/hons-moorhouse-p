Objectives need to be **SMART**



- Produce alignment tool that performs MSA on a set of supplied sequences, conserving the biological information of the sequences themselves. (i.e. no information loss/misinformation)
	- Will be tested for in automated tests

- Produce a tool which can align testcases of n x n in y amount of time?

- Produce a tool which aligns testcases in less than x seconds?


- Produce a tool that uses the established FASTA file formats

- Assess whether a single-state methods can be viable alternatives to a typical genetic algorithm approach with a comparative study.
