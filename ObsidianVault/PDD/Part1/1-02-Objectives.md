> Why is this a useful project?  What does it seek to achieve?  What is the motivation for it (not your motivation for doing the project)?  What are the **primary objectives**, and what **secondary objectives** may be achieved if there is time?  Make sure these are SMART objectives.

> I think I will do primary & secondary in PDD & then prioritized in the report?

Objectives need to be **SMART** - [[SMART Objectives]]



#### Paperwork

Deliver an unambiguous Project Definition Document (2500 words max.) which clarifies the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the project. The document should propose a timeline (including a Gantt chart) and evidence consideration of project risks, mitigations and any ethical issues.

Deliver a comprehensive Final Report (15000 words max.) which details key elements of the project, evidences independent research in the form of a literature review, and details a high-level design of the software to be delivered. Further, the report should convey a timeline of efforts to meet the objectives outlined, and include a brief report for each experiment conducted in improving the alignment algorithm.

#### Performing MSA

**correctly**

Produce alignment tool that performs MSA on a set of supplied sequences, conserving the sequence identifiers and biological information of the sequences themselves. (i.e. no information loss/misinformation)

**efficiently**

Deliver a command-line tool that can perform multiple sequence alignment on a testcase of 3 protein sequences on a university desktop computer within 5 minutes. **(Sprint 3)**

Deliver a command-line tool that can perform multiple sequence alignment on a testcase of 5 protein sequences on a university desktop computer within 1 minute. **(Sprint 5)**

Deliver a command-line tool that can perform multiple sequence alignment on a testcase of 8 protein sequences on a university desktop computer within 10 seconds. **(Sprint 6)**

**Trying Named Objective Functions**

Experiment with using a Weighted Sum-of-Pairs objective function (alone or in combination) to guide the process of sequence alignment. 

Experiment with using a Gap Penalty objective function alongside other function(s) to guide the process of sequence alignment.

Experiment with using a Totally Conserved Columns objective function alongside other function(s) to guide the process of sequence alignment.

#### Work with Established File Formats

Deliver an alignment tool that can read a set of biological sequences from a FASTA file (.faa) specified as a command line argument. **(Sprint 4)** 

Deliver an alignment tool that can output an alignment of biological sequences as a FASTA file (.faa) to the location specified in a command-line argument. **(Sprint 4)** 

#### Experiment with metaheuristics

By conducting an experiment, identify a heuristic for deciding on the number of iterations of improvement to be performed for each set of input sequences. **(Sprint 6)**

By conducting an experiment, contrast, assess and discuss quantitative differences between using a population-based or single-state metaheuristic method as the basis for the alignment software. **(Sprint 7**)



#### Case Study

Perform a comparative case study of the final tool against established MSA software such as ClustalOmega, MUSCLE etc. (**Feb/March?**)



-------

Produce an alignment tool that is compatible with Windows 11, Ubuntu and MacOS desktop computing platforms.

Provide sufficient descriptions of testing configurations such that tests of the software can be reproduced by others. i.e. specify the testcases used and the version of software tested.

#### Deliver a series of iterations of the software

> basically say that I will release the software after each sprint?
