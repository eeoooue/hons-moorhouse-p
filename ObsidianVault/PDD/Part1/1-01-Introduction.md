In this project, a software package will be developed to tackle the multi-objective optimization problem of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). 

The software will employ metaheuristic algorithms to produce high quality solutions in a time-efficient manner, and will be developed using an iterative methodology. A series of experiments will be undertaken with the goal of improving each successive iteration of the software, which will be evaluated using established benchmarks such as BAliBASE.
