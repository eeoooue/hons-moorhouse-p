> What artefacts (hardware and/or software) or results will the project deliver?  How will you decide whether the project has met its objectives?  Be clear and specific.

A command-line application that performs Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) will be delivered using an iterative development methodology. Each successive iteration will be released as on GitHub, accompanied with details of its performance on benchmark testcases.

- I'll be iteratively improving on the software & releasing something at the end of each sprint
- Once effective at performing the task of alignment, each release should/will be accompanied by a breakdown of how it performs (according to QScore) 

PDD is a deliverable
- has known sections I could list
