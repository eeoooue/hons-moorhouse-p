A command-line application that performs Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) will be delivered using an iterative development methodology. Each successive iteration will be released as on GitHub, accompanied with details of its performance on benchmark testcases.

- I'll be iteratively improving on the software & releasing something at the end of each sprint
- Once effective at performing the task of alignment, each release should/will be accompanied by a breakdown of how it performs (according to QScore)
