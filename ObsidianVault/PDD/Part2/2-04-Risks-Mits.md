Risks:
- Some factor about the problem could stump me:
	- I could define a simplified form of the problem and solve that instead
- Solving for the benchmark testcases with my algorithm + C# could be too time consuming to be practical
	- I could use make custom groups of the smaller testcases, or use simulation approaches to create smaller testcases than are available in public datasets
- The software may entirely break at some stage
	- should be mitigated by using an agile development methodology where the capability and effectiveness of the program is well documented and available as a fallback
