> Present a realistic task list for the entire project, broken down to a suitable level of detail.  **Indicate milestones against which progress can be monitored.**  Make sure you include all the deliverables you mentioned earlier.

I'll make a project task list in excel? then convert it into a list later

My milestones are:
- completion of individual experiments
- completion of specific objectives
- software iteration releases
- nfrs testing session (late in the project)
- completion of case study
- delivery of PDD
- delivery of Final Report
