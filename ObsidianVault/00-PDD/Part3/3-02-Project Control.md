> How will you manage the project day-to-day?  How will its performance be monitored?  How will you judge if it has been successful?


- Transparent discussion with my project supervisor
- Include brief reports on experiments undertaken to improve the alignment algorithm
- The testing of the software at each iteration on benchmark testcases using QScore for the SP and TC metrics will allow for the performance of the software to be monitored
- When will I test NFRs? (at the end?)
- The case study will evaluate the success of my alignment tool relative to others
- Determining whether my smart objectives have been realised will determine the success of my project
- Use MicrosoftProject, refer to my milestones

I mentioned how to go about this in my risks table

Inclusion of additional evidence in my appendix - to help reproducibility & transparency
