> How will you manage the project day-to-day?  How will its performance be monitored?  How will you judge if it has been successful?


- Transparent discussion with my project supervisor
- Include brief reports on experiments undertaken to improve the alignment algorithm
- The testing of the software at each iteration on benchmark testcases using QScore for the SP and TC metrics will allow for the performance of the software to be monitored
- When will I test NFRs? (at the end?)
- The case study will evaluate the success of my alignment tool relative to others
- Determining whether my smart objectives have been realised will determine the success of my project
- Use MicrosoftProject, refer to my milestones

I mentioned how to go about this in my risks table

Inclusion of additional evidence in my appendix - to help reproducibility & transparency


**Project Management**


**Performance Monitoring**

**Success of project**


-----

To manage the project effectively, upcoming tasks from the project schedule will be added to a separate task board (Trello) such that their progress can be monitored. Progress on tasks, especially deliverables and milestones will be discussed transparently with the project supervisor, and with reference to the project schedule. This will give opportunity to adapt the plan if necessary.

The solution quality and time-efficiency of the software will be assessed as part of each software release. The project will conclude with a comparative case study and an assessment on functional and non-functional requirements met. Following this, the overall success of the project can be evaluated with reference to the original aims and objectives. A successful project would see the development of a proficient alignment tool, compatible with existing bioinformatics file formats and accompanied by an evidenced account of its performance relative to available alternatives.
