This project will entail the development of software that performs the specialist task of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). The alignment tool will be developed using an iterative methodology and leverage metaheuristic algorithms to tackle the MSA problem. A series of experiments will be undertaken with the goal of improving each successive iteration of the software.

Despite being a key feature of some sequence alignment packages such as ClustalX, the development of a rich graphical user interface (GUI) lies outside the scope of this project. Instead, emphasis is placed on producing high-quality alignments in a time-efficient manner.

While a number of studies have explored metaheuristic approaches for MSA, this project aims to address the underrepresentation of single-state methods in recent research. Further, the project offers opportunity to explore novel combinations of objective functions to guide the optimization process.
