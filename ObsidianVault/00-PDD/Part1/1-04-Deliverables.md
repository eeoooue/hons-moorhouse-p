> What artefacts (hardware and/or software) or results will the project deliver?  How will you decide whether the project has met its objectives?  Be clear and specific.

#### Software

A series of iterations of a 'Metaheuristic Aligner' (MAli) will be released on GitHub using an iterative development methodology. A new version will be released at the end of each two-week sprint of development.

**MAli v0.1** (November 5th, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should be able to read sequences from a suitable file format and perform MSA using a simple strategy to produce a valid (though likely low-quality) alignment as output. 

**MAli v0.2** (November 19th, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should demonstrate iterative alignment using metaheuristic algorithms as a 'proof-of-concept', producing higher quality alignments than those of v0.1.

**MAli v1.0** (December 3rd, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should present a full implementation of an iterative alignment tool, improving on v0.2 in either solution quality or time-efficiency.

**MAli v1.1** (January 7th, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should result from experimentation on the design from v1.0, with the goal of improving solution quality or time-efficiency.

**MAli v1.2** (January 21st, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should approximate the 'pareto front' of MSA solutions, producing a set of alignments as output for a decision maker to choose from.

**MAli v1.3** (February 4th, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should fulfil the documented functional and non-function requirements and offer a performance or quality improvement relative to all previous iterations of the software.

#### Documents

**Project Definition Document** (October 15th, 2024) (4 weeks)

An unambiguous document (2500 words max.) which clarifies the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the project. The document should propose an overall timeline and evidence consideration of risks, mitigations and ethical concerns.

**Final Report** (Expected: April 1st, 2025) (3 months)

A comprehensive report (15000 words max.) which details key elements of the project and documents efforts to meet the objectives outlined. The report should include a literature review and conclude with a critical evaluation of the project.
