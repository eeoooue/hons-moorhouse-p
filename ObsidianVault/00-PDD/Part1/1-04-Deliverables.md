> What artefacts (hardware and/or software) or results will the project deliver?  How will you decide whether the project has met its objectives?  Be clear and specific.

A command-line application that performs Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) will be delivered using an iterative development methodology. Each successive iteration will be released as on GitHub, accompanied with details of its performance on benchmark testcases.

TODO: do be specific and say these iterations/sliced will be delivered @ named times/dates

- I'll be iteratively improving on the software & releasing something at the end of each sprint
- Once effective at performing the task of alignment, each release should/will be accompanied by a breakdown of how it performs (according to QScore) 

PDD is a deliverable
- has known sections I could list

My report is a deliverable
- has known sections I could list



#### Paperwork

An unambiguous Project Definition Document (2500 words max.) which clarifies the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the project. The document should propose a timeline (including a Gantt chart) and evidence consideration of project risks, mitigations and any ethical issues.

A comprehensive Final Report (15000 words max.) which details key elements of the project, evidences independent research in the form of a literature review, and details a high-level design of the software to be delivered. Further, the report should convey a timeline of efforts to meet the objectives outlined, and include a brief report for each experiment conducted in improving the alignment algorithm.
