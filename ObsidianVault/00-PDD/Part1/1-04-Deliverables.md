TODO: overall schedule incl. term breaks

> What artefacts (hardware and/or software) or results will the project deliver?  How will you decide whether the project has met its objectives?  Be clear and specific.

A command-line application that performs Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) will be delivered using an iterative development methodology. Each successive iteration will be released as on GitHub, accompanied with details of its performance on benchmark testcases.

TODO: do be specific and say these iterations/sliced will be delivered @ named times/dates

- I'll be iteratively improving on the software & releasing something at the end of each sprint
- Once effective at performing the task of alignment, each release should/will be accompanied by a breakdown of how it performs (according to QScore) 

PDD is a deliverable
- has known sections I could list

My report is a deliverable

#### Software

A series of iterations of a Metaheuristic Aligner (MAli) will be released on GitHub. A new version will be released at the end of each two-week development sprint.

**MAli v0.1** (November 5th, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should perform MSA using some greedy heuristic and define the general interface for the tool.
- Should be able to read sequences from a suitable file format and produce a low-quality alignment as output.

**MAli v0.2** (November 19th, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should demonstrate iterative alignment using metaheuristic algorithms as a 'proof-of-concept'.
- Should produce higher quality alignments than previously.

**MAli v1.0** (December 3rd, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should present a full implementation of an iterative alignment tool.
- Should produce higher quality alignments than previously, or perform MSA in a more time-efficient manner.

**MAli v1.1** (January 7th, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should result from experimentation on v1.0 to arrive at an improvement on the overall design.
- Relative to v1.0, should offer higher quality alignments, or improvements in time-efficiency, or both.

**MAli v1.2** (January 21st, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should approximate the 'pareto front' of MSA solutions, producing a set of alignments as output.
- Should evidence an exploration of various combinations of objectives functions for the problem.

**MAli v1.3** (February 4th, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should present the best possible alignment tool, producing high quality alignments in a time-efficient manner.
- Should fulfil the documented functional and non-function requirements.


#### Paperwork


**Project Definition Document** (October 15th, 2024) (4 weeks)

An unambiguous Project Definition Document (2500 words max.) which clarifies the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the project. The document should propose an overall timeline and evidence consideration of risks, mitigations and ethical concerns.

**Final Report** (Expected: April 1st, 2025) (3 months)

A comprehensive Final Report (15000 words max.) which details key elements of the project, evidences independent research in the form of a literature review, and details a high-level design of the software to be delivered. Further, the report should convey a timeline of efforts to meet the objectives outlined, and include a brief report for each experiment conducted in improving the alignment algorithm.
