TODO: overall schedule incl. term breaks

> What artefacts (hardware and/or software) or results will the project deliver?  How will you decide whether the project has met its objectives?  Be clear and specific.

A command-line application that performs Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) will be delivered using an iterative development methodology. Each successive iteration will be released as on GitHub, accompanied with details of its performance on benchmark testcases.

TODO: do be specific and say these iterations/sliced will be delivered @ named times/dates

- I'll be iteratively improving on the software & releasing something at the end of each sprint
- Once effective at performing the task of alignment, each release should/will be accompanied by a breakdown of how it performs (according to QScore) 

PDD is a deliverable
- has known sections I could list

#### Software

A series of iterations of a Metaheuristic Aligner (MAli) will be released on GitHub. A new version will be released at the end of each two-week development sprint.

**MAli v0.1** (November 5th, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should be able to read sequences from a suitable file format and perform MSA using a simple strategy to produce a valid (though likely low-quality) alignment as output. 

**MAli v0.2** (November 19th, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should demonstrate iterative alignment using metaheuristic algorithms as a 'proof-of-concept', producing higher quality alignments than those of v0.1.

**MAli v1.0** (December 3rd, 2024) (2 weeks)
- Should present a full implementation of an iterative alignment tool, improving on the v0.2 in either solution quality or time-efficiency.

**MAli v1.1** (January 7th, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should result from experimentation on the design from v1.0, with the goal of improving solution quality or time-efficiency.

**MAli v1.2** (January 21st, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should approximate the 'pareto front' of MSA solutions, producing a set of alignments as output for a decision maker to choose from.

**MAli v1.3** (February 4th, 2025) (2 weeks)
- Should fulfil the documented functional and non-function requirements, and be a direct improvement relative to any previous iteration of the software.


#### Paperwork

**Project Definition Document** (October 15th, 2024) (4 weeks)

An unambiguous document (2500 words max.) which clarifies the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the project. The document should propose an overall timeline and evidence consideration of risks, mitigations and ethical concerns.

**Final Report** (Expected: April 1st, 2025) (3 months)

A comprehensive report (15000 words max.) which details key elements of the project, evidences independent research and design, while documenting efforts to meet the objectives outlined and concluding with an evaluation and reflection on the project.
