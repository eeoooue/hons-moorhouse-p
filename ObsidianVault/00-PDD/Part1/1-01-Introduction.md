> Briefly summarise the project, to introduce it to the reader before the more detailed sections later on.


In this project, software will be developed to tackle the multi-objective optimization problem of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) - a common analysis task in Bioinformatics.

The alignment tool will be developed using an iterative methodology and employ metaheuristic algorithms to tackle the MSA problem. A series of experiments will be undertaken with the goal of improving each successive iteration of the software.

While a number of recent studies explore metaheuristic approaches for MSA, this project aims to address the underrepresentation of single-state methods in recent research. Further, the project has scope to explore novel combinations of objective functions for guiding the alignment process.
