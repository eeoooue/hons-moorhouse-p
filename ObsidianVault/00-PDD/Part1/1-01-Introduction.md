> Briefly summarise the project, to introduce it to the reader before the more detailed sections later on.

In this project, a software tool will be developed to tackle the multi-objective optimization problem of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) - a common analysis task in Bioinformatics. The tool will aim to produce high-quality alignments of biological sequences in a time-efficient manner.
