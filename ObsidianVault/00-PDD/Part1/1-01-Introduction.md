> Briefly summarise the project, to introduce it to the reader before the more detailed sections later on.


In this project, a software package will be developed to tackle the multi-objective optimization problem of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) - a common analysis task in Bioinformatics.

(why has this problem been chosen?) maybe incl. bullet points?

The software will be developed using an iterative methodology and employ metaheuristic algorithms to tackle the MSA problem. A series of experiments will be undertaken with the goal of improving each successive iteration of the software.
