> I think this could replace showing progress? I could always just be adding that anyway for batch alignment & it doesn't really make sense given my narrative of automated pipelines/workflows where humans aren't looking at the CLI anyway



#### Perform a Comparative Case Study

The final iteration of the alignment software should be tested against pre-existing alternatives in a comparative study. Established alternatives that could be included in the study include: MAFFT, ClustalOmega, MUSCLE. The comparison should be performed using structural benchmarks from a publicly available dataset such as BAliBASE, with clear steps for reproduction.


#### Produce A Competitive Quality Alignment Tool

The final product should aim to be a viable choice of alignment tool relative to at least one of the alternatives included in the case study described in **objective 4**. In order to be considered competitive in terms of solution quality, the tool must be shown to either;
- Produce higher quality solutions on average.
- Produce solutions of a comparable quality in a similar amount of computation time.
