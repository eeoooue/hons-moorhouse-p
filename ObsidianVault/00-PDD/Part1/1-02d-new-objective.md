#### Comparative Case Study

The final iteration of the alignment software should be tested against pre-existing alternatives in a comparative study. Established alternatives that could be included in the study include: MAFFT, ClustalOmega, MUSCLE. The comparison should be performed using structural benchmarks from a publicly available dataset such as BAliBASE, with clear steps for reproduction.
