An external review by a qualified bioinformatician will not be undertaken as part of this project, due to financial constraints. As such, this work is predicated on the assumption that the performance of alignment software as assessed via structural benchmarking is indicative of the performance of the tool at Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) in real-world contexts.

Structural benchmarks are designed to offer a comprehensive evaluation for sequence alignment (Thompson et al. 2001). These reference alignments have been manually constructed by experts using specialist knowledge, and their use is prevalent in the literature. In a review of 45 recent papers, structural benchmarking was found to be the most popular quality measure for MSA (Ibrahim et al., 2024).
