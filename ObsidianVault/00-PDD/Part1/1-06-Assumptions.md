An external review by a qualified bioinformatician will not be undertaken as part of this project, due to financial constraints. As such, this work is predicated on the assumption that the performance of alignment software as assessed via structural benchmarking is indicative of the performance of the tool at multiple sequence alignment in real-world contexts.

In a review of 45 recent papers, structural benchmarking was found to be the most popular quality measure for MSA (Ibrahim et al., 2024). However, Gori & Dessimoz (2014) advocate for a context-specific choice of benchmarking strategy, informed by the intended application of the tool.
