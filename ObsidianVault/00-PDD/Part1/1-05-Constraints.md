> Are there _externally-imposed_ requirements which you must comply with?  What are they, and how will they impact on the project?  Bear in mind that there might not be any constraints.  Note that you having already decided to use a specific technology is not an externally imposed constraint – it’s you not making that decision with proper consideration.  Note that there may not be any constraints on your project.  Delete this section if that is the case.

Constraints:
- I need to work with established Bioinformatics file formats, such as FASTA. (read and write)
	- In order to be tested effectively, my software needs to be compatible with testcases from benchmarking datasets such as BAliBASE (TODO: add citation)

As I do not have the specialist knowledge to be developing my own objective functions, the objective functions I use should be selected from literature and not synthesized.



(My constraints stem from not having biology knowledge so needing to use elements from the literature for some of my algorithm)
