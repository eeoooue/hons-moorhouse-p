In order to be a viable choice for alignment tool to bioinformaticians, the software must be compatible with established bioinformatics file formats. 

With existing alignment tools in mind, a suitable format should be chosen for reading sets of sequences as input, and outputting alignments of sequences respectively. Potential formats to consider for outputting alignments include FASTA, PHYLIP and NEXUS.
