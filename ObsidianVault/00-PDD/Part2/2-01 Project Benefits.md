If successful, the project will provide an evidenced perspective on the viability of a single-state approach for iterative sequence alignment - a gap in recent research. This could draw attention to single-state methods as candidates for further research. Further, the project has scope to contribute to the current understanding of pareto-optimization for MSA, as a new combination of objective functions could be found to be highly effective.

Should the software be shown to produce solutions of sufficiently high quality, the aligner could serve a role alongside other software packages in consensus-based sequence alignment or see direct use as a preference choice by some bioinformaticians. In both these scenarios, the project could serve to improve the accuracy of bioinformatics analysis processes dependent on sequence alignment.
