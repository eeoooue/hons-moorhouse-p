What benefit is there to my project:
- are any iterative aligners even available as CLI tools?
- potentially bring single-state methods into the spotlight as candidates for further MSA research
- potentially make a meaningful contribution to the current exploration of multiple-objective approaches for MSA

#### It Will, It Might, It's Possible That... (Is this a bad structure?)

If successful, the project will provide an evidenced perspective on the viability of a single-state approach for iterative sequence alignment - a gap in recent research. This could potentially bring single-state methods into the spotlight as candidates for further research.

The project also has scope to contribute to the current understanding of pareto-optimization for MSA, as a new combination of objective functions could be found to be highly effective.

Should the output of the alignment tool prove to be of sufficiently high quality, the aligner could serve a role alongside other software packages in consensus based sequence alignment. In the event that the tool is found to be competitive with other established software in performance and/or quality, the tool could see direct use as a preference choice by some bioinformaticians. In both these scenarios, the project could serve to improve the accuracy of bioinformatics analysis processes dependent on sequence alignment.

(TODO: reign this in, say less)
