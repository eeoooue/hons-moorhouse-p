#### There will be a lecture on how to discuss these


sickness illness
availability of the public data
loss of work?
dr parker could get sick!
sudden circumstancial changes


Risks:
- Some factor about the problem could stump me:
	- I could define a simplified form of the problem and solve that instead
- Solving for the benchmark testcases with my algorithm + C# could be too time consuming to be practical
	- I could use make custom groups of the smaller testcases, or use simulation approaches to create smaller testcases than are available in public datasets
- The software may entirely break at some stage
	- should be mitigated by using an agile development methodology where the capability and effectiveness of the program is well documented and available as a fallback

Risks of public tools for analysing data
- I'm using protein sequences from where?

Peter describes 2 types of risks:
- discrete events - something occurs
- evolving situations - something becomes a problem over time.

scope creep might be relevant to me!

TODO: suggests mind mapping.

TODO: add Likelihood + Impact; gives scales to use in lecture!!
Suggests 20 risks to identify
