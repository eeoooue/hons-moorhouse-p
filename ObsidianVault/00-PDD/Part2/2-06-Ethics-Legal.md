Ethical concerns are hard for me, it's okay to have none but:
- Transparency is key in my work - the aligner must be explainable
- Tests should be reproducible-ish (my tool won't be deterministic remember) - what testcases did I use, exact settings
- Make my program available for reproducing my testing & make this easy
- I shouldn't misrepresent the effectiveness of my tool.

I might also need to check the licenses of the structural benchmarks I'm using and how I'm allowed to share them etc.

Licenses for using QScore & the other aligners when I'm testing them?

---

licenses on the tools + the datasets?
can think beyond the release of the project
in further work - would might need considering?

-----


digital accessibility?
misuse or dual use of technology?
accountability? transparency?
academic integrity?
