Ethical concerns are hard for me, it's okay to have none but:
- Transparency is key in my work - the aligner must be explainable
- Tests should be reproducible-ish (my tool won't be deterministic remember) - what testcases did I use, exact settings
- Make my program available for reproducing my testing & make this easy
- I shouldn't misrepresent the effectiveness of my tool.

I might also need to check the licenses of the structural benchmarks I'm using and how I'm allowed to share them etc.

Licenses for using QScore & the other aligners when I'm testing them?

---

licenses on the tools + the datasets?
can think beyond the release of the project
in further work - would might need considering?

-----


digital accessibility?
misuse or dual use of technology?
accountability? transparency?
academic integrity?

#### Legal


copyright infringement
licenses of the software and datasets i use

health and safety considerations
- leaving machines running ?

This project has no foreseeable ethical implications and complies with relevant legislation such as The Computer Misuse Act. In compliance with the Data Protection Act, the project will not involve test subjects nor sensitive user data. All data to be used with the software will be either entirely synthetic or sourced from named public datasets with clear licenses.

Transparency and reproducibility are highly relevant to this work. While alignment tools are typically non-deterministic in nature, a deliberate effort will be made to communicate the methodology of all experiments undertaken as part of the project to support reproduction of results. Such details will likely include the initial settings and versioning for the tool, with reference to named test cases or datasets where feasible.
