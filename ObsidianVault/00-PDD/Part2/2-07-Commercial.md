If undertaken independently from the University of Hull, an estimated cost for this project is £10863.00. A breakdown of this estimate is presented in the table below. The key considerations for expenditure were project staff, software subscriptions and access to journal articles.

While typically not directly monetised, work of this nature may be eligible for charitable funding as it offers potential contribution to bioinformatics and applied soft computing. In other scenarios, a project of this kind might be undertaken by a private entity to develop an in-house tool as a potential advantage over competitors – for example in the pharmaceutical industry.
