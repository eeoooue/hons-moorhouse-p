I intend to use an iterative methodology:
- make something that makes a limping attempt at the job
- iteratively improve it & make it better
- release it regularly

Testing using established process popular in the literature; use of publicly available structural benchmarks to access established scoring metrics for my software's performance against test cases

This iterative approach to development should mitigate the potential risk of a bug arising in the software at the conclusion of the project. Should this occur, selecting a previous iteration of the software to roll back to will be straightforward.
