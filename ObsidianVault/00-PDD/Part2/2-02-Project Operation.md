> How will you operate the project?  Will you use a particular methodology for it and for any software or other development?  How will you measure the success of your choice?

I intend to use an iterative methodology:
- make something that makes a limping attempt at the job
- iteratively improve it & make it better
- release it regularly

Testing using established process popular in the literature; use of publicly available structural benchmarks to access established scoring metrics for my software's performance against test cases

This iterative approach to development should mitigate the potential risk of a bug arising in the software at the conclusion of the project. Should this occur, selecting a previous iteration of the software to roll back to will be straightforward.

An iterative methodology will be used for the development of the software. Drawing from the SCRUM framework (cite scrum here), development will take place in successive two-week sprints. Each sprint will conclude with a new iteration of the software being released, with changes being driven by the sprint goal. Such goals might be to experiment with new objective functions, or to pursue improvements in time efficiency.

The experiments conducted as part of the project stand to benefit from a wealth of literature on metaheuristic algorithms and approaches to the MSA problem. Further, the software can be tested for performance improvements by leveraging publicly available structural benchmark datasets which provide ‘gold standard’ reference solutions manually constructed by experts.

In addition to testing the functional and non-functional requirements of the software, a comparative study will be used to assess the final product in context of established alternatives such as MUSCLE and MAFFT (cites needed).
