**For Development**

C++ is one option, offers performance & OO development

C alignment tools can be found in the literature

C# tools aren't typical of alignment software in the literature
I like C# for the support for me as a developer, especially in the automated testing of my software's behaviour

Why have I chosen this tooling for the project:
- C# has lots of support for tooling and automated testing
- When working across disciplines, testing for established behaviours is even more valuable. 

**For Comparison**

I have access to other alignment tools for comparison against my own tool:
- ClustalOmega is the latest of a renowned lineage of alignment software 
- MUSCLE is a strong iterative aligner associated with a structural benchmarking dataset
	- fast & gives good results

Can I find a metaheuristic aligner exe to compare against?
- If not, why not? is this an opportunity/benefit for my project?

**For Communication**

When it comes to presenting my data from testing the performance and effectiveness
I will likely use python for its data visualization libraries

**For Experimentation**

I have options of metaheuristic methods, their parameters
objective functions to choose from in the literature

I will use experimentation process to pick best performers and aim to improve the efficiency and scoring of my tool wherever possible?

There is a wealth of research on the problem, while many combinations of objective functions remain unexplored.
