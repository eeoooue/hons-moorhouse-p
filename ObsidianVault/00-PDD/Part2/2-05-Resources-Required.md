What resources do I need?
- The structural references are my main external dependency
	- I could use simulated instead if they become unavailable
- I need to use someone else's scoring tool - QScore, BaliScore or other.
	- I could write my own scoring tool if the license is incompatible with my work
	- Or if I can't output files in the right format to work with it
